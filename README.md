# Machine-learning-projects

This repository contains a compilaiton of fundamental machine learning projects, details of which are as following:


1. Linear Regression project

Problem: look at a demo e-store's data to decide what part of their business shall they focus on more 

Key Steps : 
	
		•Performed EDA using matplotlib and Seaborn
		•Split train and test data
		•Used Linear Regression model from the Scikit learn library
		•Got predictions for the testing data
		•Checked predicted values with scatterplot
		•Evaluated model performance with:
		 Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error and 
		 Root mean square error and explained variance score
		 (high variance is good)
		
		•Visualized residuals to check the distribution
		 (normal distribution is desired)
		
		•Created the coefficient table to estimate the possible solution  
		
				
2. Logistic Regression project:

Problem : Created a prediction model that predicts whether or not a user will click on an ad based off the features of that user

Key Steps : 

		•Performed EDA using matplotlib and Seaborn
		•Split train and test data
		•Used Logistic Regression model from the Scikit learn library
		•Got predictions for the testing data
		•Evaluated performace using the confusion matrix and the classification report
		
3. K Means Clustering Project

Problem : Used universities data to train prediction model for 2 clusters (Public and Private)

Key Steps:

		•Performed EDA using matplotlib and Seaborn
		•Split train and test data
		•Used Kmeans model from the Scikit learn library
		•Trained a Kmeans model and predicted 2 clusters
		•Evaluated the model using confusion matrix and classification report 

			
			
4. K Nearest Neighbors project:

Problem : Performed KNN algorithm on an anonymised classified data and predicted column titles

Key Steps : 

		•Performed EDA using matplotlib and Seaborn
		•Standardised the variables
		•Split train and test data
		•Used KNN model from the Scikit learn library
		•Used Elbow Method to evaluate the performaces for different K values 
		•Optimised k value for the lowest Error Rate
		•Evaluated performace using the confusion matrix and the classification report
		
		
		
5. Decision Trees and Random Forest project

Problem : Used data for landingclub.com (2007 to 2010) to predict defaulters in loan payback

Key Steps : 

		•Performed EDA using matplotlib and Seaborn
		•Cleaned data and made dummy variables for catagorical columns
		•Split train and test data

		•Trained a decision tree model
		•Predicted values for the test data
		•Evaluated performace using the confusion matrix and the classification report

		•Trained Random Forest model with 300 estimators
		•Predicted the values on the test data
		•Evaluated performace using the confusion matrix and the classification report
	 
	 
6. Support Vector Machines project

Problem : worked on the iris flower dataset (imported from seaborn collection) 
tried to predict the species of flower with given features

Key Steps : 

		•Performed EDA using matplotlib and Seaborn
		•Split train and test data

		•Train the SVC model from sklearn
		•Evaluated the model predictions from confusion matrix and classification report

		•Optimised C and Gamma values using Grid-search
		•Predicted values using grid matrix
		•Pevaluated using confusion matric and classification report
